# Backpacking

> Backpacking is an adventure that blends hiking with backcountry camping. It lets you broaden your horizons beyond the car campground to enjoy a richer, more immersive outdoor experience. A key distinction from day hiking is the size of your pack—your backpack (and you) must carry all of life’s essentials on your back. And you must choose those essentials with care.

This repo is to share my backpacking lists, specifically the to bring list. I will be editing and updating the destinations as I come across anything.
